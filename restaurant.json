The van tan (Chinese dumpling in a soup) is by far the best in tana. The steak is very good. This is not high cuisine but excellent food that feels you up with memories of childhood and good taste.. Food was delicious, fully recommend the steak w/ potato wedges and their wonton soup w/ or w/o noodles. The food earn all my stars, on the other hand their service is rlly low due to understaffing of waiters. Often times the restaurant can be packed making their service even slower and would prioritise clients differently. It's favourable to come to this area if u don't have anything planned or if u aren't overly famished. Good price.\nHowever, a little disappointed the quantities of char siu in my usual Cantonese rice have decreased since the last time as well as the number of vantans in the vantamine soup…\nThe taste was there but the Cantonese rice and misao were drier than usual. Change of cook?\nWe ordered in advance, waited for places to become available and once seated we had to wait a long time for the misao so our family had to eat staggered (some waited a long time for the others to have their dishes) = logistical error. It doesn't look like much but the dishes are really good and accessible. A renowned establishment for a long time. Among other succulent dishes special mentions to zebu steak, tsatsiou as well as soups. Dish not too bad especially the soups.

I've been going there for years, the dishes, soups, and donuts always remain the same, only parking is a problem, then book if you want to go because there are a lot of customers.","all_rating":"5. 4. 4. 5. 5","name":"La Jonquille","latitude":-18.9093195,"longitude":47.5369177,"vicinity":"Antananarivo 101, Madagascar","photo":"https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/photo?maxwidth=400&photo_reference=AXQCQNQPOCk1PgI-dGxMV1akYUCD1F8e9zJ7qzan5Nh4abR8IKLMJREK6XtPIFSGi4mfNzY9fWcuc938R918rqA_u1CruA4KmNCm1YTEzQCLCxYkRNdj112EJBloGTjKAo6J9g1Ic6bps9lOc6Hj461rQRPOCqUPJSl53Zt9xpmT8HBPR_PTGMylUeoyMh3eu-KghRExgbqYriKREHxhkn7l_aYhJQ-3KQxL-Phh7XZ0oLMGc3UCcnIPvt79apZThZEs7n8O4iqpwFNB3olWD2xrGD6qh2Ywi2AuErS1t4nXusnqVTy8O8zHKr9O0ZRD3SRlpBvaZQ2egTSq2xDyN7JpooVKZkoDnWwlEGZOrFFLkEs60rOyoIRuGD-I0Qzzq8R2Ee8JiGvydVmHhchiZUZ5pLJFZXJ4ZyvBt5XFLT50TT-qYB10qdXah-F78Tg0fx0XlTd92Wkg_RsjvbekUin14mMYWkGeTbHDFyT3w0TCGzTwbasUnZjn7wv6La0UKWBLlrxlBngweEdMgkCyiCY_p3UqPRaKDpbaPip55TGCOLHZVCKyK0QztfmsErIqxeoaEKd1HGKH&key=VOTRE_CLE_API","place_id":"ChIJsarJ7gF-8CERhHavEwz3ykQ"},{"formated_phone_number":"033 83 594 63","international_phone_number":"+261 33 83 594 63","all_text":"Big a good portions of foods.

Would only recommend this place to people who have lived here for years and have built up a food tolerance.. Best Chinese food in Antananarivo\nService can be improved as the waiters tend to focus on one part of the restaurant, but it's not a big deal.. quite discrete but worth the try.... The food is excellent and there is a wide variety of Chinese dishes. You can have a Chinese breakfast on Sundays, the terrace is pleasant during the day with a bamboo wall. The servers are very attentive. Also ideal for lunches or dinners during the week. Prices are a little high but it's the area. We go back twice a month.\nThe clientele is Asian, which testifies to the authenticity of the dishes.. Definitely recommended, as a visitor from Asia, the meal is surely very authentic, I had the tofu with seafood. The chef came from Canton, where the essence of Chinese cuisine comes. This is a guarantee that the cuisine is very, very good, the vegetables are local and the ducks are provided by the house. The environment can still be improved a little.

I have only eaten at the noodle shop downstairs which is very simple and only seats about ten people. The soup is rich and pork has a complex spice on it that really elevates the dish. Plus the noodles are hand made in front of you. Service is very quick but it can get a bit hot in the restaurant since you are sat next to the boiling pot. All the more reason to add lots of spice to your dish.. Very authentic, Chinese Cousine. One of my favorite places in Tana (for the days where I want to taste non Malagasy food).\n\nHand made fresh noodles, made just for you. The chef is an artist\n\nUpstairs there is a „complete“ restaurant, also very good. Downstairs there is the authentic soup place. The chef here has recently arrived from China and is a specialist in Ramen noodles. Very authentic! A treat for Tana to have his talent. This restaurant is a one flight walk-up from the street. On the street level is a Chinese pulled-noodle  cafe; this restaurant is directly above.\nThe menu is in both Chinese and French, and if more help is needed there are large color photographs on one wall of the restaurant.\nThe staff is very helpful and efficient,  and I've never had a long wait.\nThe city of Dun Huang is known for their steamed dumplings, and the ones here are delicious,  served with black vinegar dipping sauce.\nOur family ordered a cucumber salad, slick with traditional sesame oil, a sweet and sour pork which was excellent, and fried rice.\nAnother time my son and I ordered a steamed fish \"Hong Kong Style\" and loved it. It was enormous and perfectly cooked. Also duck soup with Chinese mushrooms was spectacular.\nA word about portion size: Unless you are traveling with a large group or family, the small size of a portion is a safe decision.  Our small fried rice was seven servings; our small bowl of duck soup could have served 12.\nVery good value, very authentic flavors. They welcome families with small children, and many Chinese businessmen come here for lunch.. Very good handmade noodles right in front of you and Porkchop and Egg Soup 18k","all_rating":"5. 5. 4. 5. 5","name":"Dun Huang","latitude":-18.905614,"longitude":47.5240707,"vicinity":"42 Arabe Andrinampoinimerina, Antananarivo 101, Madagascar","photo":"https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/photo?maxwidth=400&photo_reference=AXQCQNTLvE1DsBQ9RYPask-9WoWdX14MP3rfjEK6MWUU2Srjq2wV1IDFZxCsH12jJSXfMsWb4IxDWVpKi-LctPjIq8HjuM9raawkF_JVfAlKSd5BdpvQhQ50A28D21J5PnuC5NM3R9esfFhGUL99yfyjEulR2IzXjGXzEGz6oanL8_bxsKI5OWjruLkuYjGImCGwqUWQzKwUzDpmaZ2_AUAX5DWYzzUt8eDc7ycd59cvcTlmjUyw-YUwMW0WgqQCgRihLFD4dx7G2M2ji0FPkHgCNI3JHboga-a5NQZlFJqvvmrc2ppn9_me0P674n5YvLJ-zCIp75HyWFTCIC7Usg9ALBS3NsQ_rWUwjuS-WYXXARl6q0WPt02ghS5wn6Au8RXp7djSBaAyNpRLfVLejWQ3ozUejnkUyVOhdRFo4F2ziXfBxxy_SNDdfQ3OURMVu-3Q1QbqaptGxIaN6QftMpjULp4WRnxsQ0y1jlSdnRSmHNSIs9POf-OjIZcJyzePD1PMAnXI-lGeJrXnQV9TPWkx0WwRngtjgR_sYCQkAUBqPQQzL6uoIkv05FOc2hYFQ8rQr4rm370Z&key=VOTRE_CLE_API","place_id":"ChIJL9u1DQF-8CER-ksYN4pb4mQ"},{"formated_phone_number":"034 79 061 61","international_phone_number":"+261 34 79 061 61","all_text":"In this area, the prices are correct, as are the dishes.

The service was excellent and the restaurant itself looked great - a wonderful atmosphere. I would definitely recommend going there.. Fantastic restaurant, whether you want traditional Chinese food or dim sum snacks, it is all delicious. The dim sum can be very fast, the dumplings are fantastic and so are the shrimp panee. The platters are delicious as well. A family favorite.. First visited about two years ago. Cosy and confortable place.  Well located in Analamahitsy facing Androhibe junction. Cool atmosphere. Good variety of mainly chinese food. Quite tasty and well served. Reasonable budget menu. One needs to be patient about 30 mins after placing order, specially on Sunday lunch.....\nVisited again recently. Slightly faster service but noted general hygiene is questionable with now lots of flies around. Taste of ordered menu was average. Will think twice before considering another visit.. Got soup with a fly boiled into it. 5 days of heavy food poisoning after. If you care about your health and don’t want to spend days with stomach ache - don’t go there.. The food was very good but it took a long time to arrive and there were very few dim sum options.","all_rating":"4. 5. 4. 1. 3","name":"La Fleur De Sel","latitude":-18.8715921,"longitude":47.5426066,"vicinity":"Antananarivo, Madagascar","photo":"https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/photo?maxwidth=400&photo_reference=AXQCQNTXsHquLPPoo0r9kA_fZF2fXNZMwaIN55mtj5XkEzAIfIt-bwCqWOUoDPtBnN5jHpEb-Mq7_RaoLh9JvScuZNa2actez37duC-C_S9ktca4ee96Cu3ZkFzN0xpZUNafU0gJbNQY8hkYduxbyTXrFQXkowZgix1ILiCvu-S87lT_4jIFgm-BNj4D7T7SNduPg6hp-pFLQvSzDX7dm5snEDUONrMBe2aam51g4JQNgV_GpBIzoXp70_L-NqSq7fY_nE67cOuYEVIQBn0bjl7hPiOzcYTbyCGmrkl4vFbk1AsSf3kn91U&key=VOTRE_CLE_API","place_id":"ChIJvyhN0sWH8CERopOmZYyfTV0"},{"formated_phone_number":"Non disponible","international_phone_number":"Non disponible","all_text":"This is a local ramen shop (soup shop).\nThe inside of the store is relatively clean.\nWonton noodles are the main dish.\nOther local dishes are also available.\n\nAlso recommended for travelers and business travelers..

Great fusion Chinese food adapted to local tastes\nRecommend the spring rolls and the bouchons. Calm and relax environment for dining.. Good Asian cuisine, wide choice, fresh produce overall.
